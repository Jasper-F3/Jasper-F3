- 👋 Hi, I’m Jasper

- 💖 I love: programming (of course), videogames (favorite: RDR2), Movies/Series, Music (Metal in general but I like a bit of everything) and I really love History,
and books about it.

- 🐣 I’m currently learning a lot of things but I don't consider myself a professional on any of it (probably because I'm trying to learn too much lol), 
anyways I'm learning: Rust, Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and programming logic in general (if anyones wants to help me learning something I shall gadly accept).

- 💞️ I’ll try to help on anything I can, I'm definitely not the best but, I'll surely dedicate myself into it.

- 🤝 You can easily reach me with, Discord: Jasper#8111 or Email: victoremanuel945@gmail.com
